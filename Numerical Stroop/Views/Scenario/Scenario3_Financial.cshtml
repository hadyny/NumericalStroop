                Imagine that your vehicle (e.g. car, scooter, motorbike) is having some trouble and the repair will cost $@ViewBag.Question1. Unfortunately,
                your insurance will only cover a portion of this cost. You need to decide the following:
            </h4>
            <ol class="scenario">
                <li>Pay the full amount in cash. Would you need to use savings? How would you get the cash?</li>
                <li>Take out a loan. To pay it back, this would require monthly payments of $@ViewBag.Question2 a month for 12 months. This would amount to $@ViewBag.Question3 total.</li>
                <li>Take a chance, don’t get it repaired, and hope that the car lasts for a while longer. Of course, then it might break-down or stop working completely which could cost more in the long-term.</li>
            </ol>
